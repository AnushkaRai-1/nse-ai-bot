SentinelQuant – AI-Driven NSE Stock Recommendation Platform

Project Overview
SentinelQuant is a production-grade, AI-driven Indian stock recommendation system that ingests NSE market data, company fundamentals, and financial news to generate risk-adjusted portfolio recommendations.
The system combines time-series deep learning (LSTM), Monte Carlo simulations, and reinforcement learning to continuously adapt to market regimes while maintaining strict financial correctness and security guarantees.

Problem It Solves:
Retail and semi-professional investors face:
Information overload (prices, indicators, news, financials)
Emotion-driven decisions
Lack of probabilistic risk assessment
No adaptive learning to changing market regimes
SentinelQuant solves this by:
Converting raw market data into statistically validated signals
Providing probability-based forecasts
Enforcing risk-adjusted capital allocation
Continuously learning from market outcomes
